Using Adaptive Fuzz
---------------------------------------

You need ocaml >= 4.02, ocamlfind, and ocamlbuild.

From the main directory, do:
$ make
to make adaptive fuzz.


How to run programs
---------------------------------------
Simply run the main executable with an input program file, as in:
$ ./fuzz tests/runTests.fz
To see extra arguments that can be provided, run:
$ ./fuzz --help
To provide arguments to the program (which take the form of a vector of 
strings), append the "-args" flag to the call, followed by the arguments.  
For instance, the following call runs the vectorized gradient descent 
example with the arguments 1000, 11, and "data/census-sample.data" (which 
indicate a database size of 1000, an epsilon of 2^(-11), and the sample 
database file).

$ ./fuzz examples/gradient-descent-vector.fz -args 1000 11 "examples/data/census-sample.data"


How to write programs
---------------------------------------
The accompanying doc/syntax.txt file has a description of the syntax for 
Adaptive Fuzz.  Built-in primitives can be found in the library files (in 
the lib/ directory), where they have accompanying type signatures and brief 
documentation.

Note that all files must terminate with an expression, and for runnable 
programs, this expression must be of type string.  The convention is that 
files that are only ever to be imported terminate with unit.  This can be 
seen in the library files.
